I've always wanted to create a technology blog but never did because i'm very lazy and setting up and maintaining such an endevor seemed so difficult. Then i looked into Github pages and realized how simple and no-cost it can be to run my own technology site. I I will try to keep the information as streamlined as possible.

## Create a free Github account

[https://github.com](https://github.com)

## Use this template to start your Github pages free site/blog

[Blogging/site template repo](https://github.com/swapan-datahawklab/swapan-datahawklab.github.io/generate)

## update the following files directly in Github in the repo created from the template

commit changes to both files below directly in Github

* open _config and update the following:

```bash
SEOTitle: Datahawk blog
header-img: img/home-bg.jpg
email:
description: "Datahawk blog"
keyword: "openshift data"
url: "https://swapan-datahawklab.github.io/"
....
....
github_username:    swapan-datahawklab
```

* open about.html and update the text in the following section to put in info about yourself

```bash
<div class="en post-container">
```

## In Settings update the following

* change the repository name to your github account name + github.io.  
    for example, for my github name is swapan-datahawklab, this repo name was changed to swapan-datahawklab.github.io.
    and the companion site is publised/updated automatically when commits are maded to the _posts directory.

* Under Features, select 'issues'

## Open your published blog at https://yourgithubname.github.io

* in settings scroll down to 'GitHub Pages' and click 'Check it out here!'
* click the link next to 'your site is published at' 
* this is the one generated for this template repo. your's will look the same but have a different URL as listed above.
